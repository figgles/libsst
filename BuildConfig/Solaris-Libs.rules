# The major difference between this file and POSIX-Libs.rules is that Solaris
# uses native threads, so linking to libpthread.so just bloats the binary. Also,
# Solaris native threads are in libc.so, so no other library is needed.

# Base libraries (console)
export ZENGINE_BASE_LIBS = -lrt -lm

# GUI libraries (X Windows)
export ZENGINE_GUI_LIBS =  -lGL -lX11
